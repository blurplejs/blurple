# Blurple.js
Mock-server with full compatibility with all of Discord's functionality, which allows you to write integration tests for all your Discord bot or app development needs.

### Packages
We employ a monorepo for development, which means that both the runtime itself, as well as all language's testing clients live within this repository.
